**UNKNOWN:** When talking about drones what is vertical video?

**UNKNOWN:**  In the context of drones, "vertical video" typically refers to footage captured with the camera oriented vertically, resulting in a tall, narrow image frame. This is in contrast to the more traditional horizontal or landscape orientation.

Some key points about vertical video in drone usage:

1. Orientation: The camera is rotated 90 degrees, so the longer side of the frame is vertical rather than horizontal.

2. Aspect ratio: Common vertical video aspect ratios include 9:16 or 4:5, as opposed to the standard 16:9 for horizontal video.

3. Social media optimization: Vertical video has become popular due to its suitability for mobile devices and social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram Stories, and Snapchat.

4. Drone capabilities: Many modern drones allow users to easily switch between horizontal and vertical video modes, either through physical camera rotation or digital cropping.

5. Use cases: Vertical video can be particularly effective for capturing tall subjects like buildings, waterfalls, or trees, or for following subjects moving vertically.

6. Limitations: Vertical orientation may not be ideal for capturing wide landscapes or horizontal movement, which are common subjects in drone videography.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of vertical video in drone usage?

**UNKNOWN:** Does Claude keep context between sessions

**UNKNOWN:**  No, I do not keep context between sessions. My memory and knowledge of our conversation is limited to only the current session. Once a conversation ends, I do not retain any information from it or carry that context forward to future interactions. Each time you start a new conversation with me, it's essentially starting from scratch in terms of my awareness of previous discussions or context.

If you need to reference something from a past conversation, you would need to provide that information again in the current session. This is an important aspect of my design to protect user privacy and ensure each interaction is independent.
